DEVELOPING ANDROID APPS COMPLETELY IN PYTHON
By Thomas Perl
The goal of this training is to show you how to start developing full Android applications using only Python. Different technologies will be demonstrated, including PySide-based QML GUIs using the Necessitas Qt port and the Py4A/SL4A-based approach, which can be combined with Android’s WebKit and re-use Python web frameworks.

While Android already has a good SDK out of the box, being able to use Python instead of Java is a big advantage for some developers - it allows for quicker turnaround times, and reuse of Python libraries. Python on Android uses a native CPython build, so its performance and compatibility is very good. Combined with PySide (which uses a native Qt build) and Qt’s support for OpenGL ES acceleration, you can create fluent UIs even with Python.

The resulting PySide-based applications run on Android, but also at least on Mac OS X, Windows, Linux and Maemo and MeeGo - basically all platforms on which Qt is available. The SL4A/Py4A-based applications will run on Android only, but will be able to utilize Android-specific APIs. Both approaches can also be combined.
